# High-Level Strategy
The key is to traverse the array once while keeping track of potential candidates for the increasing triplet. We'll use two variables to store the smallest and the second smallest numbers encountered so far. These variables help us identify a potential sequence that satisfies the triplet condition.

# Detailed Steps
Initialize Two Variables:

First Minimum (first): Initialize this to a very large number (e.g., positive infinity). This variable will hold the smallest number found so far.
Second Minimum (second): Also initialize this to a very large number. This will hold the next smallest number greater than first.
Iterate Through the Array:

For each element num in the array nums, perform the following checks:
Update first and second:

If num is less than or equal to first:
Update first to be num. This means we've found a new smallest number.
Else if num is less than or equal to second:
Update second to be num. This means num is greater than first but smaller than the current second, so it becomes the new candidate for the second smallest number.
Else:
If num is greater than both first and second, we've found our increasing triplet (first, second, num). Return true.
No Triplet Found:

If we complete the iteration without finding such a triplet, return false.
Rationale Behind the Approach
Maintaining Potential Candidates:
By continuously updating first and second, we are effectively keeping track of the smallest and the next smallest numbers that could potentially form an increasing triplet with a future number.

# Why This Works:
If at any point we find a number greater than both first and second, it inherently satisfies the condition nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k] with i, j, and k being the positions where first, second, and num were found, respectively.
