# Sorting Terminology
- In-place Sorting: An in-place sorting algorithm uses constant space for producing the output(modifies the given array only)
or copying elements to a temporary storage. Example: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insection Sort and Heap Sort.
- Internal Sorting: Internal Sorting is when all the data is placed in the main memory or internal memory. In internal
sorting, the problem cannot take input beyong its size. Example: Heap Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort,
Shell Sort and Insertion Sort.
- External Sorting: External Sorting is when all the data that needs to be sorted cannot be placed in memory at a time.
It is used for the massive amout of data. Example: Merge sort, Tag Sort, Polyphase Sort, Four tape sort, etc.


# Time complexity symbols:
- Ω - Big Omega is used to repsent the best-case scenario of an algorithm.
            When an algorithm is fiven the simplestes data-structure possible as input.
- O - BigO is used to repsent the worst-case scenario of an algorithm.
            When an algorithm is given a very large and comples data-set as input
- Θ - Big Theta is used only when the time complexity of an algorithm is the
            the same in both worst-case and best-case scenarios.
